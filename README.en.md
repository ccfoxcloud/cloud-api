## Process

Before using our cloud API, few steps need to be taken:

1. A transfer function and individual contract transaction account for each registered user are required in **your system/application**.
   - Make sure funds could be transferred between normal account and contract transaction account.
2. A confirmation function in **your system/application** for user to allow the contract trading, then:
   - After the confirmation of user agreement is received, helping this user to register a new account in **our system** by using the [Sub-account registration](https://github.com/ccfoxcloud/cloud-api/blob/master/doc/api.en.md#sub-account-registration) API. This new registered account will be a child account under your **parent business account**.
3. A fund transfer function in **your application/system**.
   - Fund transfer could be done between normal account and contract transaction account.
   - When a user transfers the fund from a normal account to a **contract transaction account** in **your system/application**, the [Transferring API](https://github.com/ccfoxcloud/cloud-api/blob/master/doc/api.en.md#transfer) will be invoked in our system for transferring the fund from your parent business account to the user's child account.
   - Pre-deposit is recommended for a better user experience due to long loading time of blockchain transactions.
   - Regular fund balancing between **your application/system** and **your parent business account** would be necessary. Therefore, the [Inquire Assets API](https://github.com/ccfoxcloud/cloud-api/blob/master/doc/api.en.md#inquire-assets) might be useful to check your parent business account and those child accounts under your parent account.
4. Embed our front-end trading page into **your system/application** we prepared for you.
   - Invoke the API of [Sub-account login API](https://github.com/ccfoxcloud/cloud-api/blob/master/doc/api.en.md#Sub-account-login) for users to login in **our system/application** when users access the **front-end trading page**.
5. The user-related notification (e.g. deleveraging or liquidated) will be pushed by MQ(message queue), thus you may need to adjust your system/application to adapt the configuration of the [Business Message Queue API](https://github.com/ccfoxcloud/cloud-api/blob/master/doc/api.md#business-message-queue).The template is provided in the project [notificationTemplate](通知模板.csv)
